This is a portfolio project that I made during my journey at codecademy.

The program is a recommendation software for finding movies based on categories.

The user start to search by typing the first character or the first few characters and the program will return a list of related movies categories.

There are 5 modules that builds up the main structure of the software...

   1) linkedList.py module wich store the liked list class that I've chosen as data structure
   2) movie.py module wich holds the Movie class that will be stored inside the LinkedList class
   3) quicksort.py wich is the algorithm that I've chosen to sort the movies lists in place by title
   4) binary_search.py is the algorithm that will seek for the right category
   5) main.py is the main program file and it's responsible for displaying the content and to handle the user input

The use of a binary search algorithm in this simple implementation is not necessary but I decided to use it anyway to make the program more efficient and more interesting.
